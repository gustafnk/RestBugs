This intent of this branch is to use it as an internal lab for Jayway.

To install the dependencies
> npm install

To start the app
> node app.js 9200

This will use a mongo database on mongolab.

If you want to use a local database, read line 4 and 5 in app.js. You need to have mongodb installed an running for this.
